# Hush-Now-Gregory
Data type, variable and loop names may differ from how they appear in the paper.  
The program is set to run with default settings if run as \_\_main\_\_.  
Doing so requires the folder HNGFiles to be in the path.  
Otherwise, import HushNowGregory in a different script and run HushNowGregory.search(startAshInput, spaceshipOutput, \*\*kwargs).  
Arguments go as follows:
```
Arguments:
    startAshInput:
        File containing RLE describing initial ash that the program will attempt to perturb to produce spaceships/specified stable output
    spaceshipOutput:
        File to output reactions that produce spaceships onto
Keyword Arguments:
    minDivGens:
        Minimum number of consecutive generations a reaction must deviate based on its most recently added parvoship
        for the addition of said parvoship to be considered a meaningful search branch
        Defaults to 3
    testRunLimit:
        Number of generations after the projected first interaction between the puff and the most recently added parvoship that the program
        will consider the reaction a spaceship producing reaction
        Defaults to 300
    resultAshInOut:
        Tuple like object containing two filenames
        The program will search for reactions that produce stable ash that matches the RLEs listed in first file
        These reactions will be outputted in the second file
        If one of the RLEs in the first file contains only dead cells, the program will search for a deleter flotilla
        for the given start ash
Example:
    search("startAshInputRLE.txt","spaceshipOutputRLEs.txt",resultAshInOut=("resultAshInRLEs.txt","resultAshOutRLEs.txt"))
```
Note that Hush Now Gregory will only read the first RLE listed in startAshInput, whereas Super Hush Now Gregory can start with multiple start ashes, thus reading every RLE listed in startAshInput. Super Hush Now Gregory also utilizes an experimental pruning mechanism that prevents the algorithm from exploring flotillas that walk the puff along closed loops on the directed graph of puff configuarions where each edge indicates a way one configuration can be perturbed to evolve into another. This prevents the search tree from being clogged up by permutations of the same few sub flotillas arranged in a chain.

| PatternGrid.parvosRemoved()       | PatternGrid.Puff()         | In the Python code returns a PatternGrid, which, for the purposes of the Python contains fields for the coordinates and bounding box of the pattern. The returned PatternGrid's bounding box contains any dead cells in the output that are non-dead cells in a parvoship in the PatternGrid that ParvosRemoved() is being called on. This prevents the algorithm from prematurely declaring stabilization because it ignored the effect missing cells in a parvoship will have on the flotilla's evolution. |
| PatternGrid.strictlyEquals(other) |                            | The Python code takes advantage of how PatternGrid.parvosRemoved returns a PatternGrid whose bounding box contains missing parvoship cells by calling this method to compare the current puff to previous generations of puff when testing for stabilization. The method compares the contents, positions, and bounding boxes of the two PatternGrids so stabilization is not declared prematurely.                                                                                                          |
